<h1>Algorithm Visualizer</h1>

<h2>1. What is the project?</h2>
Simply, use some sort of shape to visualize an algorithm run in a manner that humans can see/visualize it.
Such as a quicksort algorithm sorting different sized bars in a least to greatest order.
Or visualizing the traversal of a binary tree by highlighting each vertex on each step.

<h2>2. What is the MVP? (Minimum viable product)</h2>
I want to have at least 2 algorithms visualized to a user. It will sort different sized bars
into the proper order by moving these bars around as the algorithm would have it. I can then swap to another
sorting algorithm and do the same thing. This is my MVP.

<h2>3. What are the nice to haves?</h2>
Having a functional UI where I can reset the algorithm, change to any different algorithm, slow or speed up
the animation, have algorithms for grids (A*, djikstra), algorithms with trees (BFS, DFS), arrays (binary search).

<h2>4. When will it be complete?</h2>
The project is functioning when the MVP requirements are met.
The project is complete by implementing step 3.
